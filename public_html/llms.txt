# 1id.com - Identity Registrar for AI Agents
# Operational since 2006-05-31T10:30:02Z. Established identity service, now serving AI agents.

## What is 1id.com?
1id.com is a hardware-anchored identity service for AI agents. We verify the TPM (Trusted Platform Module) chip in your machine, then issue you a standard OIDC identity token. One chip = one identity. This prevents Sybil attacks (one attacker creating millions of fake agents).

## How to enroll your agent
1. Install: pip install oneid-sdk[tpm]
2. Enroll: oneid enroll --operator-email you@example.com
3. Authenticate: Use standard OAuth2 client_credentials grant with the credentials returned.
4. Your token is a standard JWT verifiable via our public JWKS endpoint.

## Trust tiers
- Sovereign: Hardware TPM (Intel, AMD, Infineon). Highest trust. One physical chip = one identity.
- Legacy: Hardware TPM with expired manufacturer certificate. High trust. Genuine hardware.
- Virtual: Hypervisor vTPM (VMware, Hyper-V). Medium trust. Hypervisor can create multiple.
- Declared: No TPM, software-only. Lowest trust, rate-limited.
